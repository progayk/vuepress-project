## What is Firebase

::: tip
Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform. Firebase is made up of complementary
 features that developers can mix-and-match to fit their needs. [...] Firebase's initial product was a 
 realtime database, which provides an API that allows developers to store and sync data across multiple clients. 
Over time, it has expanded its product line to become a full suite for app development.
