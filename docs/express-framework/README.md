## What is a framework? How is it different from a library?

Frameworks and libraries are conceptually same. Both are written by other people and 
you can install and use it just by adding to your project. However, frameworks are different than libraries.
The most important difference, and in fact the defining difference between a library and a framework is [Inversion of Control](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0ahUKEwiYnNKm7JLbAhWGIpoKHV-tD6cQFggxMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInversion_of_control&usg=AOvVaw2tuRUAl26TmEMEZq4GcDKP). What does this means that when using a library the control is on you; on the contrary, when using frameworks the control not is on you; so, the control is **inverted**.

Basically, all the control flow is already in the **framework**, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code.

A **library**, on the other hand, is a collection of functionailty that you can call.

What framework does is basically setting up the necessary environment that an app needs. So, we don't have to do everything from scratch when we want to use the same setup.

## What is express?

Express is a **web development framework**. There are other frameworks like **Python Django**, **Ruby on Rails** etc.

## Why are we using Express?

The first reason, express is the by far is the most used node framework. It's a very lightweight framework. It means, you have more control on the framework, and the framework doesn't hide anything from you. Also, it's good for having a deeper insight on why you are doing what you are doing.
