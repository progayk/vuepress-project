**Abstract**

Creating native-like animations and flowless transtions on web pages is a though problem. Depending on old technologies like jQuery and keep using old methods to create web pages are depreceted now. The world enters into a new era. In this era the things that were pixaleted, cornered and fluent(fluid) once will be smooth and fluent. Throughout this course I will be making projects which then be used in my future projects. Also, I will be learning Vue.js, JavaScript and Node.js. The first one is obvious but the rest might be ommitted.
